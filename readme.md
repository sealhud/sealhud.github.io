# SealHUD Redirect Repository

This is a WebHud for Raceroom based on original OtterHud.
Since OtterHud is not being updated anymore and it still works with its telemetry, I created this new repository on GitHub where I can make simple fixes and keep it minimally updated.

In order to make it usable, you need to change the Raceroom launch parameter on STEAM and point it to my repository: 

-webHudUrl=https://sealhud.github.io/

Remember to update your CrewChief to the latest version, or if you use dash.exe, update the executable to the newest version: https://sealhud.github.io/dash.zip

If more people are interested in contributing to the maintenance of this dash, they are more than welcome.
